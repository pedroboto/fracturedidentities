                Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed. This
                includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as
                relationships with each other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can
                change over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender is hierarchical and produces inequalities that intersect with other social and economic
                inequalities. Gender-based discrimination intersects with other factors of discrimination, such as
                ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability, age, geographic location, gender identity and sexual
                orientation, among others. This is referred to as intersectionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender interacts with but is different from sex, which refers to the different biological and
                physiological characteristics of females, males and intersex persons, such as chromosomes, hormones and
                reproductive organs. Gender and sex are related to but different from gender identity. Gender identity
                refers to a person’s deeply felt, internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not
                correspond to the person’s physiology or designated sex at birth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender influences people’s experience of and access to healthcare. The way that health services are
                organized and provided can either limit or enable a person’s access to healthcare information, support
                and services, and the outcome of those encounters. Health services should be affordable, accessible and
                acceptable to all, and they should be provided with quality, equity and dignity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender inequality and discrimination faced by women and girls puts their health and well-being at risk.
                Women and girls often face greater barriers than men and boys to accessing health information and
                services. These barriers include restrictions on mobility; lack of access to decision-making power;
                lower literacy rates; discriminatory attitudes of communities and healthcare providers; and lack of
                training and awareness amongst healthcare providers and health systems of the specific health needs and
                challenges of women and girls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consequently, women and girls face greater risks of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted
                infections including HIV, cervical cancer, malnutrition, lower vision, respiratory infections,
                malnutrition and elder abuse, amongst others. Women and girls also face unacceptably high levels of
                violence rooted in gender inequality and are at grave risk of harmful practices such as female genital
                mutilation, and child, early and forced marriage. WHO figures show that about 1 in 3 women worldwide
                have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence
                in their lifetime.
              </p>
              <p>
                Harmful gender norms – especially those related to rigid notions of masculinity – can also affect boys
                and men’s health and wellbeing negatively. For example, specific notions of masculinity may encourage
                boys and men to smoke, take sexual and other health risks, misuse alcohol and not seek help or health
                care. Such gender norms also contribute to boys and men perpetrating violence – as well as being
                subjected to violence themselves. They can also have grave implications for their mental health.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rigid gender norms also negatively affect people with diverse gender identities, who often face
                violence, stigma and discrimination as a result, including in healthcare settings. Consequently, they
                are at higher risk of HIV and mental health problems, including suicide.

                <br>
                (in languages such as Latin, French, and German) each of the classes (typically masculine, feminine,
                common, neuter) of nouns and pronouns distinguished by the different inflections which they have and
                which they require in words syntactically associated with them. Grammatical gender is only very loosely
                associated with distinctions of sex.
                <br>
                _the property (in nouns and related words) of belonging to a grammatical gender. (“determiners and

                Origin of the word
                <br>
                late Middle English: from Old French gendre (modern genre), based on Latin genus ‘birth, family,
                nation’. The earliest meanings were ‘kind, sort, genus’ and ‘type or class of noun, etc.’ (which was
                also a sense of Latin genus).

                The words sex and gender have a long and intertwined history. In the 15th century gender expanded from
                its use as a term for a grammatical subclass to join sex in referring to either of the two primary
                biological forms of a species, a meaning sex has had since the 14th century; phrases like “the male sex”
                and “the female gender” are both grounded in uses established for more than five centuries.
              </p>
              <p>
                The distinction between sex and gender is attributed to the anthropologist Margaret Mead (Sex and
                Temperament in Three Primitive Societies, 1935). Sex is the biological category, whereas gender is the
                culturally shaped expression of sexual difference: the masculine way in which men should behave and the
                feminine way in which women should behave. It is emphasized by de Beauvoir that in this system woman is
                the Other: the kind of person whose characteristics are described by contrast with the male norm. It is
                a central aim of much feminist thought to uncover concealed asymmetries of power in differences of
                gender, and to work for a society in which the polarization of gender is abolished.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 20th century sex and gender each acquired new uses. Sex developed its "sexual intercourse"
                meaning in the early part of the century (now it's more common meaning), and a few decades later gender
                gained a meaning referring to the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated
                with one sex, as in "gender roles." Later in the century, gender also came to have application in two
                closely related compound terms: gender identity refers to a person's internal sense of being male,
                female, some combination of male and female, or neither male nor female; gender expression refers to the
                physical and behavioral manifestations of one's gender identity. By the end of the century gender by
                itself was being used as a synonym of gender identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among those who study gender and sexuality, a clear delineation between sex and gender is typically
                prescribed, with sex as the preferred term for biological forms, and gender limited to its meanings
                involving behavioral, cultural, and psychological traits. In this dichotomy, the terms male and female
                relate only to biological forms (sex), while the terms masculine/masculinity, feminine/femininity,
                woman/girl, and man/boy relate only to psychological and sociocultural traits (gender). This delineation
                also tends to be observed in technical and medical contexts, with the term sex referring to biological
                forms in such phrases as sex hormones, sex organs, and biological sex. But in nonmedical and
                nontechnical contexts, there is no clear delineation, and the status of the words remains complicated.
                Often when comparisons explicitly between male and female people are made, we see the term gender
                employed, with that term dominating in such collocations as gender differences, gender gap, gender
                equality, gender bias, and gender relations. It is likely that gender is applied in such contexts
                because of its psychological and sociocultural meanings, the word's duality making it dually useful. The
                fact remains that it is often applied in such cases against the prescribed use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Usage of sex and gender is by no means settled. For example, while discrimination was far more often
                paired with sex from the 1960s through the 20th century and into the 21st, the phrase gender
                discrimination has been steadily increasing in use since the 1980s and is on track to become the
                dominant collocation. Currently both terms are sometimes employed with their intended synonymy made
                explicit: sex/gender discrimination, gender (sex) discrimination.

                Anthropology produced some of the first influential theories using the term "gender" when it began
                discussing "gender roles." The background to this concept lay in post–World War I research. Margaret
                Mead, most notably, described non-Western societies where men performed tasks that Westerners might call
                "feminine" and vice versa. Mead described many variations in men's and women's tasks and sexual roles in
                her best-selling studies (such as Coming of Age in Samoa; 1928), opening one way for scholars to
                reappraise the seemingly fixed behaviors of men and women and to see stereotypes as contingent rather
                than determined by nature. Such a reappraisal, however, lay in the wings for much of the 1950s and
                1960s.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another source of gender theory was philosophical and literary. "One is not born, one is made a woman,"
                the French philosopher and novelist Simone de Beauvoir wrote in her 1949 best-seller, The Second Sex.
                This dense and lengthy description of the "making" of womanhood discussed Marxist, Freudian, literary,
                and anthropological theories that, according to Beauvoir, actually determined women's behavior. In her
                view women, in contrast to men, acted in accordance with men's view of them and not according to their
                own lights. This analysis drew on phenomenological and existential philosophy that portrayed the
                development of the individual subject or self in relationship to an object or "other." Thus, as Beauvoir
                extrapolated from this theory, a man formed his subjectivity in relationship to "woman" as other or
                object, spinning his own identity by creating images of someone or something that was not him. Instead
                of building selves in a parallel way, women accepted male images of them as their identity. By this
                view, femininity as most women lived it was an inauthentic identity determined not inevitably, as a
                natural condition, but as the result of a misguided choice. This insight had wide-ranging implications
                for future scholarship, notably in suggesting a voluntaristic aspect to one's sexual role or nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                A second extrapolation from existentialism in The Second Sex, however, did touch on women's biological
                role as reproducer. For existentialists, living an authentic life entailed escaping the world of
                necessity or biology and acting in the world of contingency. From this creed Beauvoir posited that women
                were additionally living an inauthentic life to the extent that they just did nature's bidding by having
                children and rearing them. They should search for freedom and authenticity through meaningful actions
                not connected with biological necessity. The assertion that women could escape biological destiny to
                forge an existence apart from the family also opened the way to gender theory. A group of translators in
                the Northampton, Massachusetts, area working under the aegis of H. M. Parshley made The Second Sex
                available to an anglophone audience in the 1950s, and in 1963 Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique further
                spread Beauvoir's lines of thought to Americans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beauvoir's was not the only French doctrine to lay some of the groundwork for gender theory. During that
                same postwar period Claude Lévi-Strauss, an anthropologist, developed the theory called structuralism.
                According to structuralist theory, people in societies lived within frameworks of thought that
                constituted grids for everyday behavior. These frameworks were generally binary, consisting of
                oppositions such as pure and impure, raw and cooked, or masculine and feminine. Binaries operated with
                and against one another as relationships. One could draw from structuralism that in the case of
                masculine and feminine, these concepts or characteristics were mutually definitional because they shared
                a common border, which, once crossed, tipped feminine behavior into masculine and vice versa. Although
                Lévi-Strauss saw these binaries as fixed, the ground was laid once again for seeing masculinity and
                femininity both as interlocking and as a part of culture, even though a more fixed one, as well as a
                part of biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lévi-Strauss developed these theories in The Elementary Structures of Kinship (1949), in which he took
                kinship, as the fundamental organizing category of all society, to be based on the exchange of women.
                The American anthropologist Gayle Rubin elaborated on Lévi-Strauss in "The Traffic in Women" (1975), an
                article that further developed gender theory. Citing Marxist and Freudian deficiencies in thinking about
                women and men, Rubin essentially underscored the hierarchical character of the relationship between men
                and women as an ingredient of what anthropologists and sociologists were coming to call gender: "the
                subordination of women can be seen as a product of the relationships by which sex and gender are
                organized and produced." The second point Rubin extrapolated from Lévi-Strauss was that the most
                important taboo in all societies was the sameness of men and women. This "imperative" of sexual
                difference was what made "all manifest forms of sex and gender," which were thus "a socially imposed
                division of the sexes." This imposed sexual difference "transform[ed] males and females into 'men' and
                'women.' " By 1980 the phrase "social construction of gender" was commonplace among anthropologists,
                sociologists, and some psychologists. To quote a 1978 textbook: "Our theoretical position is that gender
                is a social construction, that a world of two 'sexes' is a result of the socially shared,
                taken-for-granted methods which members use to construct reality" (Suzanne Kessler, Gender: An
                Ethnomethodological Approach, p. vii).

                Gender, race, ethnicity, and social class are the most commonly used categories in sociology. They
                represent the major social statuses that determine the life chances of individuals in heterogeneous
                societies, and together they form a hierarchy of access to property, power, and prestige.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender is the division of people into two categories, "men" and "women." Through interaction with
                caretakers, socialization in childhood, peer pressure in adolescence, and gendered work and family
                roles, women and men are socially constructed to be different in behavior, attitudes, and emotions. The
                gendered social order is based on and maintains these differences.
              </p>
              <p>
                In sociology, the main ordering principles of social life are called institutions. Gender is a social
                institution as encompassing as the four main institutions of traditional sociology—family, economy,
                religion, and symbolic language. Like these institutions, gender structures social life, patterns social
                roles, and provides individuals with identities and values. And just as the institutions of family,
                economy, religion, and language are intertwined and affect each other reciprocally, as a social
                institution, gender pervades kinship and family life, work roles and organizations, the rules of most
                religions, and the symbolism and meanings of language and other cultural representations of human life.
                The outcome is a gendered social order.
              </p>
              <p>
                The source of gendered social orders lies in the evolution of human societies and their diversity in
                history. The gendered division of work has shifted with changing means of producing food and other
                goods, which in turn modifies patterns of child care and family structures. Gendered power imbalances,
                which are usually based on the ability to amass and distribute material resources, change with rules
                about property ownership and inheritance. Men's domination of women has not been the same throughout
                time and place; rather, it varies with political, economic, and family structures, and is differently
                justified by religions and laws. As an underlying principle of how people are categorized and valued,
                gender is differently constructed throughout the world and has been throughout history. In societies
                with other major social divisions, such as race, ethnicity, religion, and social class, gender is
                intricately intertwined with these other statuses.
              </p>
              <p>
                As pervasive as gender is, it is important to remember that it is constructed and maintained through
                daily interaction and therefore can be resisted, reformed, and even rebelled against. The social
                construction perspective argues that people create their social realities and identities, including
                their gender, through their actions with others—their families, friends, colleagues. It also argues that
                their actions are hemmed in by the general rules of social life, by their culture's expectations, their
                workplace's and occupation's norms, and their government's laws. These social restraints are amenable to
                change—but not easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender is deeply rooted in every aspect of social life and social organization in Western-influenced
                societies. The Western world is a very gendered world, consisting of only two legal categories—"men" and
                "women." Despite the variety of playful and serious attempts at blurring gender boundaries with
                androgynous dress and desegregating gender-typed jobs, third genders and gender neutrality are rare in
                Western societies. Those who cross gender boundaries by passing as a member of the opposite gender, or
                by sex-change surgery, want to be taken as a "normal" man or woman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although it is almost impossible to be anything but a "woman" or a "man," a "girl" or a "boy" in Western
                societies, this does not mean that one cannot have three, four, five, or more socially recognized
                genders—there are societies that have at least three. Not all societies base gender categories on male
                and female bodies—Native Americans, for example, have biological males whose gender status is that of
                women. Some African societies have females with the gender status of sons or husbands. Others use age
                categories as organizing principles, not gender statuses. Even in Western societies, where there are
                only two genders, we can think about restructuring families and workplaces so they are not as rigidly
                gendered as they are today.

                Gender was first conceptualized as distinct from sex in order to highlight the social and cultural
                processes that constructed different social roles for females and males and that prescribed
                sex-appropriate behavior, demeanor, personality characteristics, and dress. However, sex and gender were
                often conflated and interchanged, to the extent that this early usage was called "sex roles" theory.
                More recently, gender has been conceptually separated from sex and also from sexuality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding gender practices and structures is easier if what is usually conflated as sex/gender or
                sex/sexuality/gender is split into three conceptually distinct categories—sex (or biology, physiology),
                sexuality (desire, sexual preference, sexual orientation, sexual behavior), and gender (social status,
                position in the social order, personal identity). Each is socially constructed but in different ways.
                Gender is an overarching category—a major social status that organizes almost all areas of social life.
                Therefore bodies and sexuality are gendered—biology and sexuality, in contrast, do not add up to gender.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conceptually separating sex and gender makes it easier to explain how female and male bodies are
                socially constructed to be feminine and masculine through sports and in popular culture. In medicine,
                separating sex from gender helps to pinpoint how much of the differences in longevity and propensity to
                different illnesses is due to biology and how much to socially induced behavior, such as alcohol and
                drug abuse, which is higher among men than women. The outcome is a greater number of recorded illnesses
                but longer life expectancy for women of all races, ethnicities, and social classes when compared to men
                with the same social characteristics. This phenomenon is known in social epidemiology as "women get
                sicker, but men die quicker."

                As with any other aspect of social life, gender is shaped by an individual's genetic heritage, physical
                body, and physiological development. Socially, however, gendering begins as soon as the sex of the fetus
                is identified. At birth, infants are placed in one of two sex categories, based on the appearance of the
                genitalia. In cases of ambiguity, since Western societies do not have a third gender for hermaphrodites
                as some cultures do, the genitalia are now "clarified" surgically, so that the child can be categorized
                as a boy or a girl. Gendering then takes place through interaction with parents and other family
                members, teachers, and peers ("significant others"). Through socialization and gendered personality
                development, the child develops a gendered identity that, in most cases, reproduces the values,
                attitudes, and behavior that the child's social milieu deems appropriate for a girl or a boy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Borrowing from Freudian psychoanalytic theory, Nancy Chodorow developed an influential argument for the
                gendering of personalities in the two-parent, heterogendered nuclear family. Because women are the
                primary parents, infants bond with them. Boys have to separate from their mothers and identify with
                their fathers in order to establish their masculinity. They thus develop strong ego boundaries and a
                capacity for the independent action, objectivity, and rational thinking so valued in Western culture.
                Women are a threat to their independence and masculine sexuality because they remind men of their
                dependence on their mothers. However, men need women for the emotional sustenance and intimacy they
                rarely give each other. Their ambivalence toward women comes out in heterosexual love–hate relationships
                and in misogynistic depictions of women in popular culture and in novels, plays, and operas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Girls continue to identify with their mothers, and so they grow up with fluid ego boundaries that make
                them sensitive, empathic, and emotional. It is these qualities that make them potentially good mothers
                and keep them open to men's emotional needs. But because the men in their lives have developed
                personalities that make them emotionally guarded, women want to have children to bond with. Thus,
                psychological gendering of children is continually reproduced.
              </p>
              <p>
                To develop nurturing capabilities in men and to break the cycle of the reproduction of gendered
                personality structures would, according to this theory, take fully shared parenting. There is little
                data on whether the same psychic processes produce similarly gendered personalities in single-parent
                families, in households where both parents are the same gender, or in differently structured families in
                non-Western cultures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Children are also gendered at school, in the classroom, where boys and girls are often treated
                differently by teachers. Boys are encouraged to develop their math abilities and science interests;
                girls are steered toward the humanities and social sciences. The result is that women students in the
                United States outnumber men students in college, but only in the liberal arts; in science programs, men
                still outnumber women. Men also predominate in enrollment in the elite colleges, which prepare for
                high-level careers in finance, the professions, and government.
              </p>
              <p>
                This data on gender imbalance, however, when broken down by race, ethnicity, and social class, is more
                complex. In the United States, upper- and middle-class boys are pushed ahead of girls in school and do
                better on standardized tests, although girls of all social statuses get better grades than boys.
                African-American, Hispanic, and white working-class and poor boys do particularly badly, partly because
                of a peer culture that denigrates "book learning" and rewards defiance and risk taking. In the context
                of an unresponsive educational structure, discouraged teachers, and crowded, poorly maintained school
                buildings, the pedagogical needs of marginal students do not get enough attention; they are also much
                more likely to be treated as discipline problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Children's peer culture is another site of gender construction. On playgrounds, girls and boys divide up
                into separate groups whose borders are defended against opposite-gender intruders. Within the group,
                girls tend to be more cooperative and play people-based games. Boys tend to play rule-based games that
                are competitive. These tendencies have been observed in Western societies; anthropological data about
                children's socialization shows different patterns of gendering. Everywhere, children's gender
                socialization is closely attuned to expected adult behavior.

                An increasing recognition of this complexity by researchers and the public has affirmed that gender sits
                on a spectrum: People are more and more willing to acknowledge the reality of nonbinary and transgender
                identities, and to support those who courageously fight for their rights in everything from all-gender
                bathrooms to anti-gender-discrimination laws. But underlying all of this is the perception that no
                matter the gender a person identifies as, they have an underlying sex they were born with. This
                represents a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of biological sex. Science keeps showing us
                that sex also doesn’t fit in a binary, whether it be determined by genitals, chromosomes, hormones, or
                bones.
              </p>
              <p>
                The perception of a hard-and-fast separation between the sexes started to disintegrate during the second
                wave of feminism in the 1970s and 1980s. In the decades that followed, we learned that about 1.7 percent
                of babies are born with intersex traits; that behavior, body shape, and size overlap significantly
                between the sexes, and both men and women have the same circulating hormones; and that there is nothing
                inherently female about the X chromosome. Biological realities are complicated. People living their
                lives as women can be found, even late in life, to be XXY or XY.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early 1900s, the U.S.-based anthropologist Aleš Hrdlička helped to found the modern study of
                human bones. He served as the first curator of physical anthropology at the U.S. National Museum (now
                the Smithsonian Institution). The skeletons Hrdlička studied were categorized as either male or female,
                seemingly without exception. He was not the only one who thought sex fell into two distinct categories
                that did not overlap. Scientists Fred P. Thieme and William J. Schull of the University of Michigan
                wrote about sexing a skeleton in 1957: “Sex, unlike most phenotypic features in which man varies, is not
                continuously variable but is expressed in a clear bimodal distribution.” Identifying the sex of a
                skeleton relies most heavily on the pelvis (for example, females more often have a distinctive bony
                groove), but it also depends on the general assumption that larger or more marked traits are male,
                including larger skulls and sizable rough places where muscle attaches to bone. This idea of a distinct
                binary system for skeletal sex pervaded—and warped—the historical records for decades.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1972, Kenneth Weiss, now a professor emeritus of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State
                University, noticed that there were about 12 percent more male skeletons than females reported at
                archaeological sites. This seemed odd, since the proportion of men to women should have been about half
                and half. The reason for the bias, Weiss concluded, was an “irresistible temptation in many cases to
                call doubtful specimens male.” For example, a particularly tall, narrow-hipped woman might be mistakenly
                cataloged as a man. After Weiss published about this male bias, research practices began to change. In
                1993, 21 years later, the aptly named Karen Bone, then a master’s student at the University of
                Tennessee, Knoxville, examined a more recent dataset and found that the bias had declined: The ratio of
                male to female skeletons had balanced out. In part that might be because of better, more accurate ways
                of sexing skeletons. But also, when I went back through the papers Bone cited, I noticed there were more
                individuals categorized as “indeterminate” after 1972 and basically none prior.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allowing skeletons to remain unsexed, or “indeterminate,” reflects an acceptance of the variability and
                overlap between the sexes. It does not necessarily mean that the skeletons classified this way are, in
                fact, neither male nor female, but it does mean that there is no clear or easy way to tell the
                difference. As science and social change in the 1970s and 1980s revealed that sex is complicated, the
                category of “indeterminate sex” individuals in skeletal research became more common and improved
                scientific accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                For generations, the false perception that there are two distinct biological sexes has had many negative
                indirect effects. It has muddied historical archaeological records, and it has caused humiliation for
                athletes around the globe who are closely scrutinized. In the mid-1940s, female Olympic athletes went
                through a degrading process of having their genitals inspected to receive “femininity certificates.”
                This was replaced by chromosome testing in the late 1960s and subsequently, hormone testing. But instead
                of rooting out imposters, these tests just illustrated the complexity of human sex.
              </p>
              <p>
                It might be more convenient for the U.S. federal government to have a binary system for determining
                legal sex; many U.S. laws and customs are built on this assumption. But just because it’s a convenient
                system of classification doesn’t mean it’s right. Some countries, such as Canada, and some states in the
                U.S., including Oregon, now allow people to declare a nonbinary gender identity on their driver’s
                license or other identification documents. In a world where it is apparently debatable whether
                anti-discrimination laws apply to sex or gender, it is a step in the wrong direction to be writing
                either one into law as a strictly binary phenomenon.
              </p>
              <p>
                The famous cases of strong, athletic, and audacious female athletes who have had their careers derailed
                by the Olympic “gender tests” exemplify how misguided it is to classify sex or gender as binary. These
                women are, like all of us, part of a sex spectrum, not a sex binary. The more we as a society recognize
                that, the less we will humiliate and unnecessarily scrutinize people—and the less discriminatory our

                France invaded Vietnam in the later nineteenth century. Its motivations were economic and strategic,
                though there were wider, romantic fascinations with the Pacific in the minds of many leaders.
                Consequences of France’s colonial administration would include the spread of plantations producing
                rubber, a wealthy class of colonial owners and administrators and, ultimately, fierce and successful
                Vietnamese anti-colonialism.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consequences also included new visions of gender. French officials in Vietnam became quickly confused by
                how the Vietnamese seemed to look, and their confusion was enhanced by a sense of superiority rooted in
                conquest. The men, first of all, seemed effeminate. They were small-boned and slender. Their faces
                seemed hairless: as a French military doctor noted, “The absence of beards and the general appearance
                hardly permit us to distinguish the sexes.” Vietnamese soldiers, with colorful and unfamiliar uniforms,
                looked like “women costumed for circus pantomime.” It was easy to ridicule the vanquished in gender
                terms. The French were also fascinated by eunuchs in the Vietnamese royal court—officials who had been
                castrated so they could not trouble women in the royal family, a widespread tradition in various parts
                of Asia that was actually being phased out in Vietnam. Eunuchs were described as “human monsters,” with
                the vices of both sexes. Add to this a standard conqueror fear that Vietnamese men were dangerously
                oversexed—even though this did not at all comport with the idea of effeminacy—and the sense of weirdness
                could be overwhelming, though also easily justifying the belief that superior French people should rule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Women were also scrutinized. First impressions by upper-class French officials emphasized how ugly
                Vietnamese women were—thick bodied, devoted to physical labor (as were French peasant women, but the
                colonial officials rarely saw them). “A man or a woman?” one French intellectual asked: “In this
                country, one never knows: same costume, same ugliness.” But women—again, the contradictions, held
                together only by the belief in superiority—were also sexually immoral libertines, easily induced into
                affairs with the colonialists. There was a widespread belief that many Vietnamese families indulged in
                incest, so few young girls could avoid molestation.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1900, with French administration fully established, another voice was heard: French women resident in
                the colonies. They viewed themselves as representing French civilization, eager to set up households
                that looked just like those back home (though with more local servants, of course, since they were
                cheap). They disliked Vietnamese women who formed relationships with French men—as an observer (male)
                put it, “Some of them display a ferocious jealousy in this regard.” They were eager to promote efforts
                to teach Vietnamese women European-style respectability and domesticity, even though this often involved
                more emphasis on subservience to fathers and husbands than the Vietnamese themselves had traditionally
                urged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here, then, was massive gender contact—even though this contact was a byproduct of other, expansive
                imperialist goals. Europeans had firm gender standards at this point, emphasizing how different men and
                women were. This fact, plus their status as nervous conquerors, made it easy to find another gender
                system strange and reprehensible, though also sometimes exciting. Weirdness and exaggeration are common
                features when one society encounters the gender standards of another. So, when conquest is involved, are
                efforts to run down local masculinity. Habits of colonial administration—from underrating the local
                military to assuming that local women seek sexual relationships—are powerful results of these kinds of
                contacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                What about the other part of the exchange? Some Vietnamese would deeply resent French attitudes. Others
                might seek to adjust gender behavior, including styles of dress, to appear more respectable, and this
                could have frivolous, or demeaning, or liberating results, depending on the situation. Some would be
                eager to reassert older standards, including a sense of proud masculinity; this would factor into later
                anti-colonial violence, when a colonial tendency to dis- count military prowess might also make
                resistance easier. It was unlikely that gender standards, either for those in occupation or for those
                being occupied, could ever return to their pre-contact levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contact possibilities have many faces. A society that stresses women’s deference may encounter one that
                believes women are more moral than men. A society that values masculinity but in which men are
                relatively short may meet another society that thinks masculinity is only truly possible when men are
                tall. A society tolerant of homosexuality may meet one rigorously repressive, a key issue in the world
                right now. The permutations are numerous, intriguing and often extremely important in defining
                relationships between societies and in stimulating change in gender standards when contact occurs.

                All cultures of the world must deal with the division of labor between the sexes, and exactly how they
                do this has been the topic of much research and debate. Like culture, the awareness and recognition of
                sex and gender differences, and of course similarities, have played a prominent role in the development
                of contemporary knowledge in psychology. This recognition is complemented by an abundance of studies in
                cross-cultural psychology and anthropology that have been concerned with the relationship between
                culture and gender.

                Even though biological factors may impose predispositions and restrictions on development, sociocultural
                factors are important determinants of development (Best & Williams, 1993; Munroe & Munroe, 1975/1994;
                Rogoff, Gauvain, & Ellis, 1984). Culture has profound effects on behavior, prescribing how babies are
                delivered, how children are socialized, how children are dressed, what is considered intelligent
                behavior, what tasks children are taught, and what roles adult men and women will adopt. The scope and
                progression of the children’s behaviors, even behaviors that are considered biologically determined, are
                governed by culture. Cultural universals in gender differences are often explained by similarities in
                socialization practices, while cultural differences are attributed to differences in socialization.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the best known, although often questioned, examples of cultural diversity in gender-related
                behaviors is Margaret Mead’s classic study of three tribes in New Guinea (Mead, 1935). Mead reported
                that, from a Western viewpoint, these societies created men and women who are both masculine and
                feminine and who reversed the usual gender roles. The pervasive nature of sex differences in behaviors
                was poignantly illustrated in the Israeli kibbutz, established in the 1920s, where there was a
                deliberate attempt to develop egalitarian societies (Rosner, 1967; Snarey & Son, 1986; Spiro, 1956).
                Initially, there was no sexual division of labor. Both women and men worked in the fields, drove
                tractors, and worked in the kitchen and in the laundry. However, as time went by and the birth rate
                increased, it was soon discovered that women could not undertake many of the physical tasks of which men
                were capable. Women soon found themselves in the same roles from which they were supposed to have been
                emancipated—cooking, cleaning, laundering, teaching, caring for children. The kibbutz attempts at
                equitable division of labor seemed to have little effect on the children. Carlsson and Barnes (1986)
                found no cultural or sex differences between kibbutz raised children and Swedish children regarding how
                they conceptualized typical female and male sex role behaviors or in their sextyped self-attributions.

                One of the most important insights in women's and then gender history began with a simple question—Did
                women have a Renaissance?—first posed by the historian Joan Kelly in 1977. Her answer, "No, at least not
                during the Renaissance," led to intensive historical and literary research as people attempted to
                confirm, refute, modify, or nuance her answer. This question also contributed to the broader questioning
                of the whole notion of historical periodization. If a particular development had little, or indeed a
                negative, effect on women, could it still be called a "golden age," a "Renaissance," or an
                "Enlightenment"? Can the seventeenth century, during which hundreds or perhaps thousands of women were
                burned as witches on the European continent, still be described as a period of "the spread of rational
                thought"?
              </p>
              <p>
                Kelly's questioning of the term "Renaissance" has been joined more recently by a questioning of the term
                "early modern." Both historians and literary scholars note that there are problems with this term, as it
                assumes that there is something that can unambiguously be called "modernity," which is usually set
                against "traditional" and linked with contemporary Western society. The break between "medieval" and
                "early modern" is generally set at 1500, roughly the time of the voyages of Columbus and of the
                Protestant Reformation, but recently many historians argue that there are more continuities across this
                line than changes. Some have moved the decisive break earlier—to the Black Death in 1347 or even to the
                twelfth century—or have rejected the notion of periodization altogether. Gender historians, most
                prominently Judith Bennett, have been among those questioning the validity of the medieval/modern
                divide, challenging, in Bennett's words, "the assumption of a dramatic change in women's lives between
                1300 and 1700" and asserting that historians must pay more attention to continuities along with changes.

              <p>
                During the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries male and female writers in many countries of
                Europe wrote both learned and popular works debating the nature of women. Beginning in the sixteenth
                century, this debate also became one about female rulers, sparked primarily by dynastic accidents in
                many countries that led to women serving as advisers to child kings or ruling in their own right. The
                questions vigorously and at times viciously disputed directly concerned the social construction of
                gender: could a woman's being born into a royal family and educated to rule allow her to overcome the
                limitations of her sex? Should it? Or stated another way: which was (or should be) the stronger
                determinant of character and social role, gender or rank?
              </p>
              <p>
                The most extreme opponents of female rule were Protestants who went into exile on the Continent during
                the reign of Mary Tudor (ruled 1553–1558), most prominently John Knox, who argued that female rule was
                unnatural, unlawful, and contrary to Scripture. Being female was a condition that could never be
                overcome, and subjects of female rulers needed no other justification for rebelling than their monarch's
                sex. Their writings were answered by defenses of female rule which argued that a woman's sex did not
                automatically exclude her from rule, just as a boy king's age or a handicapped king's infirmity did not
                exclude him. Some theorists asserted that even a married queen could rule legitimately, for she could be
                subject to her husband in her private life, yet monarch to him and all other men in her public life. As
                Constance Jordan has pointed out, defenders of female rule were thus clearly separating sex from gender
                and even approaching an idea of androgyny as a desirable state for the public persona of female
                monarchs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jean Bodin (1530–1596), the French jurist and political theorist, stressed what would become in the
                seventeenth century the most frequently cited reason to oppose female rule: that the state was like a
                household, and just as in a household the husband/father has authority and power over all others, so in
                the state a male monarch should always rule. Male monarchs used husbandly and paternal imagery to
                justify their assertion of power over their subjects, though criticism of monarchs was also couched in
                paternal language; pamphlets directed against the crown during the revolt known as the Fronde in
                seventeenth-century France, for example, justified their opposition by asserting that the king was not
                properly fulfilling his fatherly duties.
              </p>
              <p>
                This link between royal and paternal authority could also work in the opposite direction to enhance the
                power of male heads of household. Just as subjects were deemed to have no or only a very limited right
                of rebellion against their ruler, so women and children were not to dispute the authority of the
                husband/father, because both kings and fathers were held to have received their authority from God; the
                household was not viewed as private, but as the smallest political unit and so part of the public realm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many analysts see the Protestant Reformation and, in England, Puritanism as further strengthening this
                paternal authority by granting male heads of household a much larger religious and supervisory role than
                they had under Catholicism. The fact that Protestant clergy were themselves generally married heads of
                household also meant that ideas about clerical authority reinforced notions of paternal and husbandly
                authority; priests were now husbands, and husbands priests. After the Reformation, the male citizens of
                many cities and villages increasingly added an oath to uphold the city's religion to the oaths they took
                to defend it and support it economically. For men, faith became a ritualized civic matter, while for
                women it was not. Thus both the public political community and the public religious community—which were
                often regarded as the same in early modern Europe—were for men only, a situation reinforced in the
                highly gendered language of the reformers, who extolled "brotherly love" and the religious virtues of
                the "common man."
              </p>
              <p>
                Religious divisions were not the only development that enhanced the authority of many men. Rulers intent
                on increasing and centralizing their own authority supported legal and institutional changes that
                enhanced the power of men over the women and children in their own families. In France, for example, a
                series of laws were enacted between 1556 and 1789 that increased both paternal and state control of
                marriage. Young people who defied their parents were sometimes imprisoned by what were termed lettres de
                cachet, documents that families obtained from royal officials authorizing the imprisonment without trial
                of a family member who was seen as a source of dishonor. Men occasionally used lettres de cachet as a
                means of solving marital disputes, convincing authorities that family honor demanded the imprisonment of
                their wives, while in Italy and Spain a "disobedient" wife could be sent to a convent or house of refuge
                for repentant prostitutes. Courts generally held that a husband had the right to beat his wife in order
                to correct her behavior as long as this was not extreme, with a common standard being that he not draw
                blood, or that the diameter of the stick he used not exceed that of his thumb.
              </p>
              <p>
                Access to political power for men as well as women was shaped by ideas about gender in early modern
                Europe. The dominant notion of the "true" man was that of the married head of household, so that men
                whose class and age would have normally conferred political power but who remained unmarried did not
                participate to the same level as their married brothers; in Protestant areas, this link between marriage
                and authority even included the clergy.

                Notions of masculinity were important symbols in early modern political discussions. Both male and
                female rulers emphasized qualities regarded as masculine—physical bravery, stamina, wisdom,
                duty—whenever they chose to appear or speak in public. A concern with masculinity pervades the political
                writings of Machiavelli, who used "effeminate" to describe the worst kind of ruler. (Effeminate in the
                early modern period carried slightly different connotations than it does today, however, for strong
                heterosexual passion was not a sign of manliness, but could make one "effeminate," that is, dominated by
                as well as similar to a woman.) The English Civil War (1642–1649) presented two conflicting notions of
                masculinity: Royalist cavaliers in their long hair and fancy silk knee-breeches, and Puritan
                parliamentarians with their short hair and somber clothing. Parliamentary criticism of the court was
                often expressed in gendered and sexualized terminology, with frequent veiled or open references to
                aristocratic weakness and inability to control the passions.

                The maintenance of proper power relationships between men and women served as a basis for and a symbol
                of the functioning of society as a whole. Women or men who stepped outside their prescribed roles in
                other than extraordinary circumstances, and particularly those who made a point of emphasizing that they
                were doing this, were seen as threatening not only relations between the sexes, but the operation of the
                entire social order. They were "disorderly," a word that had much stronger negative connotations in the
                early modern period than it does today, as well as two somewhat distinct meanings—outside of the social
                structure and unruly or unreasonable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Women were outside the social order because they were not as clearly demarcated into social groups as
                men. Unless they were members of a religious order or guild, women had no corporate identity at a time
                when society was conceived of as a hierarchy of groups rather than a collection of individuals. One can
                see women's separation from such groups in the way that parades and processions were arranged in early
                modern Europe; if women were included, they came at the end as an undifferentiated group, following men
                who marched together on the basis of political position or occupation. Women were also more "disorderly"
                than men because they were unreasonable, ruled by their physical bodies rather than their rational
                capacities, their lower parts rather than their upper parts. This was one of the reasons they were more
                often suspected of witchcraft; it was also why they were thought to have nondiabolical magical powers in
                the realms of love and sexual attraction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Disorder in the proper gender hierarchy was linked with other types of social upheaval and viewed as the
                most threatening way in which the world could be turned upside down. Carnival plays, woodcuts, and
                stories frequently portrayed domineering wives in pants and henpecked husbands washing diapers alongside
                professors in dunce caps and peasants riding princes. Men and women involved in relationships in which
                the women were thought to have power—an older woman who married a younger man, or a woman who scolded
                her husband—were often subjected to public ridicule, with bands of neighbors shouting insults and
                banging sticks and pans in their disapproval. Adult male journeymen refused to work for widows although
                this decreased their opportunities for employment. Fathers disinherited disobedient daughters more often
                than sons. The derivative nature of an adult woman's authority—the fact that it came from her status as
                wife or widow of the male household head—was emphasized by referring to her as "wife" rather than
                "mother" even in legal documents describing her relations with her children. Of all the ways in which
                society was hierarchically arranged—class, age, rank, race, occupation—gender was regarded as the most
                "natural" and therefore the most important to defend.

                Gender theory developed in the academy during the 1970s and 1980s as a set of ideas guiding historical
                and other scholarship in the West. In social history it particularly thrived in the United States and
                Great Britain, with far fewer followers on the European continent. Essentially this theory proposed
                looking at masculinity and femininity as sets of mutually created characteristics shaping the lives of
                men and women. It replaced or challenged ideas of masculinity and femininity and of men and women as
                operating in history according to fixed biological determinants. In other words, removing these
                categories from the realm of biology, it made a history possible. For some, the idea of "gender history"
                was but another term for women's history, but for others gender theory transformed the ways in which
                they approached writing and teaching about both men and women. To some extent it may be hypothesized
                that the major change brought about by gender theory was that it complicated the study of men, making
                them as well as women gendered historical subjects.

                Gayle Rubin’s article "The Traffic in Women" (1975) directed scholars to psychoanalysis, and for some,
                concepts drawn from psychoanalysis also contributed to gender theory, resulting in a limited number of
                historical applications by the 1990s. Rubin saw the Oedipal moment, as pinpointed first by Sigmund
                Freud, as being that moment when the societal norm of sexual difference was installed in each psyche.
                Her article publicized the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, whose writings fused the insights of
                Lévi-Strauss with an updated Freudianism. Rubin admitted that Freud, Lévi-Strauss, and Lacan could be
                seen as advocates for the sexism of the psyche and society, yet she also valued them and urged scholars
                to value them for the descriptions they provided of sexism as a deeply ingrained psychosocial
                institution. As a result of Rubin's and others' investigations into psychoanalysis and its relevance to
                scholarship, some gender theory came to absorb this ingredient too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Freud's publications between 1899 and 1939 touched on questions of women's sexuality and identity
                formation. His formulations saw a psychosexual development for women that depended on imaginings of the
                male phallus, and of the female genitalia as in essence lacking one. Privileging the phallus, as did the
                little boy, the little girl understood her "lack" and that of her mother as somehow a devaluation of
                femininity. This drove her to appreciate male superiority and to throw herself eagerly into the arms of
                a man (first her father and then her husband) as part of the development of a normative, heterosexual
                femininity with marriage and motherhood—not career—as goals. Boys, in contrast, feared that they might
                become castrated like their mothers, whose genitals they interpreted as deficient, and thus came to fear
                their fathers, repress their normal, infantile love for their mothers, and construct an ego and sense of
                morality based on identification with masculinity and accomplishment. In the case of both boys and
                girls, however, there were many roads to adult identity based on a number of ways of interpreting
                biology and the parental image. Thus, in two regards Freudianism became an important ingredient of
                gender theory: first, it posited an identity that, although related to biology, nonetheless depended on
                imaginings of biology in relationship to parental identities. Freeing male and female from a strict
                biological determinism, Freud furthermore saw psychosexual identity as developing relationally. That is,
                the cultural power of the male phallus was only important in relationship to feminine lack of the
                phallus or castration. This relativity of masculine and feminine psyches informed gender theory.
              </p>
              <p>
                The theories of Jacques Lacan nuanced Freudianism and became both influential and contested in gender
                theory. Lacan described the nature of the split or fragmented subject in even stronger terms. Freud had
                seen the rational, sexual, and moral regimes within the self as in perpetual contest. In an essay on the
                "mirror stage" in human development, Lacan claimed a further, different splitting. The baby gained an
                identity by seeing the self first in terms of an other—the mother—and in a mirror, that is, again, in
                terms of an other. Both of these images were fragmented ones because the mother disappeared from time to
                time, as did the image in the mirror. The self was always this fragmented and relational identity. Lacan
                also posited language as a crucial influence providing the structures of identity and the medium by
                which that identity was spoken. In speaking, the self first articulated one's "nom" or name—which was
                the name of one's "father"—and simultaneously and homonymically spoke the "non," the proscriptions or
                rules of that language, which Lacan characterized as the laws of the "father" or the laws of the
                phallus. Lacanianism added to gender theory a further sense of the intertwined nature of masculinity and
                femininity, beginning with identity as based on the maternal imago and fragmented because of it. Second,
                it highlighted the utterly arbitrary, if superficially regal, power of masculinity as an extension of
                the phallus, or cultural version of the male organ. Third, the fantasy nature of the gendered self and
                indeed of all of human identity and drives received an emphasis that became crucial to some
                practitioners of gender history.

                Under the sign of what came to be known as "French feminism," French theorists picked up on Lacanian,
                structuralist, and other insights to formulate a position that contributed to gender theory. For these
                theorists, such as Luce Irigaray, masculine universalism utterly obstructed feminine subjectivity. What
                Simone de Beauvoir called "the Other" had nothing to do with women but amounted to one more version of
                masculinity—male self-projection. Women thus appeared as erasure, as lack, and, in Irigaray's This Sex
                Which Is Not One (1985), as unrepresentable in ordinary terms. The woman was the divided, nonunitary,
                fragmented self. The result for the writing of social history were such compendia as Michelle Perrot's
                Une histoire des femmes est-elle possible? (Is a history of women possible?; 1984). The question of how
                one writes the history of fragments, "decentered subjects," and other characters for whom there are no
                historical conventions was addressed in some writing derived from French feminism. To some extent, Joan
                Scott's Only Paradoxes to Offer (1996) tried to execute that project by eliminating biography and story
                from her account of French feminists.
              </p>
              <p>
                The French philosopher Michel Foucault contested the standard interpretation of social and political
                power as a palpable force emanating from a single source. Rather, power was almost a Nietzschean life
                force circulating through society, thus constituting a mesh in which all people operated. The mesh or
                grid of power produced subjects or, more commonly, people as they articulated its principles. Thus, for
                instance, in his famous History of Sexuality (1977) Foucault maintained that speaking about sex or
                behaving in some flauntingly sexual way was not in and of itself a liberatory act but rather an
                articulation of social rules about sex and thus a participation in power and the law. Foucault saw the
                work of the modern state as an increasingly invisible implication of people in the exercise of power
                around bodily issues—thus the sense in his work of biopower present in the activities of doctors, the
                clergy, government officials, and ordinary reformers. Downplaying or even eliminating the traditional
                sense of human agency, Foucault's work actually fit with some theories current in social history in the
                1970s, notably that branch investigating people's behavior as opposed to their subjectivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many aspects of Foucault's theories immediately fed into French social history of women. Arlette Farge,
                a French social and cultural historian, described the lives of eighteenth-century Parisians in a
                Foucauldian manner. That is, reading police and legal records, she saw those lives as "produced" and
                coming into being in this legal encounter (La vie fragile: Violence, pouvoirs, et solidarités à Paris au
                XVIIIe siècle ; 1986). In presenting answers to questioners, they gave shape to their lives, as did
                neighbors and other witnesses. At the same time, they protested and resisted accusations and
                characterizations. Farge's accounts also showed the production of gender by the law, although this
                theory had not yet taken on a definite shape in historical work. Similarly Foucauldian, Alain Corbin's
                Les filles de noce: Misère sexuelle et prostitution (1978) interpreted legalized prostitution as arising
                from the state's ambition to regulate and oversee even these sexual acts. Life in the brothel had its
                special textures, but these were sex workers' experience of the state.

                Although many of these theories had more or less influence on the social history of women, in 1986 they
                came together when the historian Joan Scott issued a stirring manifesto about gender theory in
                AmericanHistorical Review. Scott's "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis" asked historians
                to transform social scientific understandings of gender by adding Lacanian psychoanalysis, Jacques
                Derrida's deconstruction (a philosophical theory showing the difficulties in assigning definite meanings
                or truth to texts), and Foucauldian-Nietzschean definitions of power. In her view Marxist,
                anthropological, and psychological moves toward understanding gender had reached a dead end because they
                tended to see male and female as having essential or enduring characteristics. Marxism always saw
                women's issues as inexorably subordinate to issues of class, and feminists who believed in Marxism had
                no convincing way of explaining men's oppression of women. Nor, for that matter, according to Scott, did
                those feminist scholars who studied patriarchy or sought out "women's voices." Despite great progress,
                even those who now followed the lead of the "binary oppositions" of structuralist anthropology could not
                account for them. The rigidity of the male-female categories in any of these systems, especially in the
                work of those who sought out women's "voices" and "values," kept gender from being as useful as it could
                be.
              </p>
              <p>
                As palliative, Scott considered the way the trio of French theorists could overcome the rigidities of
                gender theory as it had evolved to the mid-1980s. Lacanian psychoanalysis rested in part on the Swiss
                linguist Ferdinand de Saussure's understanding of language as a system in which words had meaning only
                in relationship to one another. It coupled this insight with revised Freudian ideas about the psychic
                acquisition of identity as a process shaped by the supremely high value placed on the phallus, and it
                was this value that the symbolic system of language expressed. For Scott, Lacanianism and all the
                psychic variation it involved were one key to understanding gender as an exigent, inescapable
                relationship. Foucault's theory of power as a field in which all humans operated offered another
                valuable insight. Scott suggested that using Foucault allowed for the introduction of gender issues into
                political history, thus overcoming the separation that historians had maintained between women's history
                and the political foundation on which most historical writing rested.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scott also explained that gender could be a category or subject of discussion through which power
                operated. It could operate thus in several ways. For one, because gender meant differentiation, it could
                be used to distinguish the better from the worse, the more important from the less important. Using the
                term "feminine" articulated a lower place in a social or political hierarchy. Additionally, gender
                explained or assigned meaning to any number of phenomena, including work, the body, sexuality, politics,
                religion, cultural production, and an infinite number of other historical fields. Because many of these
                were fields where social history had established itself and where Scott herself had done major work as
                well, gender theory of her variety found a welcoming audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                The philosopher Judith Butler offered other poststructuralist versions of gender theory that influenced
                historians. In two highly celebrated books, Gender Trouble (1990) and Bodies That Matter (1993), Butler
                argued against talking of femininity in terms of an essential womanhood. Drawing on a range of theories,
                Butler proposed to discuss human action less in terms of the behavior of a knowing and conscious subject
                and more as an iteration of social rules. The fact that actions were the iteration of rules should not
                lead to fatalism, Butler maintained, for such iterations in appropriate settings could have upsetting
                consequences and even make for social change. Bodies That Matter made an important contribution to
                debates in gender theory that saw gender as "constructed" and sex or the body as somehow more "real" and
                determined by biology. Butler's response was to deny "sex" as a ground for the "construction of gender."
                "Sex" was as constructed as gender, especially the construction of "sex" as being more fundamental or
                real than gender.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1990 Scott, Butler, and other scholars had provided two critiques that shaped the use of gender
                theory in social history. The first was the critique of universalism, meaning the critique of narratives
                and analyses that took women as having their womanhood in common. Although social historians had been
                more conscientious than most in assessing class interests, Marxist tendencies in social history tended
                to see class as a universal tool, one that overrode particularities such as race and gender. The
                critique of universals particularly brought to the fore women of color and women outside the Western
                framework of social history. Similarly, the critique of essentialism served to encourage more
                particularist studies because it denied an essence to womanhood. Denise Riley's "Am I That Name?":
                Feminism and the Category of "Women'' in History (1988) showed that womanhood as an essential category
                was constructed in the nineteenth century to represent the "social" and thus a unified essence. The
                critique of essentialism went even further, however. Joan Scott's "Evidence of Experience" argued that
                even the claiming of a group identity or essence based on one's own experience that was shared with
                others was impossible as an authentic or originary entity.

                People began talking about feminism as a series of waves in 1968 when a New York Times article by Martha
                Weinman Lear ran under the headline “The Second Feminist Wave.” “Feminism, which one might have supposed
                as dead as a Polish question, is again an issue,” Lear wrote. “Proponents call it the Second Feminist
                Wave, the first having ebbed after the glorious victory of suffrage and disappeared, finally, into the
                sandbar of Togetherness.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The wave metaphor caught on: It became a useful way of linking the women’s movement of the ’60s and ’70s
                to the women’s movement of the suffragettes, and to suggest that the women’s libbers weren’t a bizarre
                historical aberration, as their detractors sneered, but a new chapter in a grand history of women
                fighting together for their rights. Over time, the wave metaphor became a way to describe and
                distinguish between different eras and generations of feminism.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can reduce each wave to a stereotype and suggest that there’s a sharp division between generations of
                feminism, when in fact there’s a fairly strong continuity between each wave — and since no wave is a
                monolith, the theories that are fashionable in one wave are often grounded in the work that someone was
                doing on the sidelines of a previous wave. And the wave metaphor can suggest that mainstream feminism is
                the only kind of feminism there is, when feminism is full of splinter movements.
              </p>
              <p>
                And as waves pile upon waves in feminist discourse, it’s become unclear that the wave metaphor is useful
                for understanding where we are right now.

                People have been suggesting things along the line of “Hmmm, are women maybe human beings?” for all of
                history, so first-wave feminism doesn’t refer to the first feminist thinkers in history. It refers to
                the West’s first sustained political movement dedicated to achieving political equality for women: the
                suffragettes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 70 years, the first-wavers would march, lecture, and protest, and face arrest, ridicule, and
                violence as they fought tooth and nail for the right to vote. As Susan B. Anthony’s biographer Ida
                Husted Harper would put it, suffrage was the right that, once a woman had won it, “would secure to her
                all others.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The first wave basically begins with the Seneca Falls convention of 1848. There, almost 200 women met in
                a church in upstate New York to discuss “the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of
                women.” Attendees discussed their grievances and passed a list of 12 resolutions calling for specific
                equal rights — including, after much debate, the right to vote.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time, the nascent women’s movement was firmly integrated with the abolitionist movement. Women of
                color like Sojourner Truth, Maria Stewart, and Frances E.W. Harper were major forces in the movement,
                working not just for women’s suffrage but for universal suffrage. But despite their immense work for the
                women’s movement, it eventually established itself as a movement specifically for white women, one that
                used racial animus as fuel for its work.
              </p>
              <p>
                “If educated women are not as fit to decide who shall be the rulers of this country, as ‘field hands,’
                then where’s the use of culture, or any brain at all?” demanded one white woman who wrote in to Stanton
                and Anthony’s newspaper, the Revolution. “One might as well have been ‘born on the plantation.’” Black
                women were barred from some demonstrations or forced to walk behind white women in others.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1920, Congress passed the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. In theory, it granted the
                right to women of all races, but in practice, it remained difficult for black women to vote.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 19th Amendment was the grand legislative achievement of the first wave. Although individual groups
                continued to work — for reproductive freedom, for equality in education and employment, for voting
                rights for black women — the movement as a whole began to splinter. It no longer had a unified goal with
                strong cultural momentum behind it, and it would not find another until the second wave began to take
                off in the 1960s.

                “One is not born but rather becomes a woman” (de Beauvoir 1953, p. 249).
              </p>
              <p>
                The second wave of feminism begins with Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique, which came out in 1963.
                There were prominent feminist thinkers before Friedan who would come to be associated with the second
                wave — most importantly Simone de Beauvoir, whose Second Sex came out in France in 1949 and in the US in
                1953 — but The Feminine Mystique was a phenomenon.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Feminine Mystique rails against “the problem that has no name”: the systemic sexism that taught
                women that their place was in the home and that if they were unhappy as housewives, it was only because
                they were broken and perverse. “I thought there was something wrong with me because I didn’t have an
                orgasm waxing the kitchen floor,” (Betty Friedan).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Feminine Mystique was not revolutionary in its thinking, as many of Friedan’s ideas were already
                being discussed by academics and feminist intellectuals. Instead, it was revolutionary in its reach. It
                made its way into the hands of housewives, who gave it to their friends, who passed it along through a
                whole chain of well-educated middle-class white women with beautiful homes and families. And it gave
                them permission to be angry.
              </p>
              <p>
                So the movement won some major legislative and legal victories: The Equal Pay Act of 1963 theoretically
                outlawed the gender pay gap; a series of landmark Supreme Court cases through the ’60s and ’70s gave
                married and unmarried women the right to use birth control; Title IX gave women the right to educational
                equality; and in 1973, Roe v. Wade guaranteed women reproductive freedom.
              </p>
              <p>
                But perhaps just as central was the second wave’s focus on changing the way society thought about women.
                The second wave cared deeply about the casual, systemic sexism ingrained into society — the belief that
                women’s highest purposes were domestic and decorative, and the social standards that reinforced that
                belief — and in naming that sexism and ripping it apart.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second wave cared about racism too, but it could be clumsy in working with people of color. As the
                women’s movement developed, it was rooted in the anti-capitalist and anti-racist civil rights movements,
                but black women increasingly found themselves alienated from the central platforms of the mainstream
                women’s movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I don’t think of myself as a feminist,” a young woman told Susan Bolotin in 1982 for the New York Times
                Magazine. “Not for me, but for the guy next door that would mean that I’m a lesbian and I hate men.”
              </p>
              <p>
                That image of feminists as angry and man-hating and lonely would become canonical as the second wave
                began to lose its momentum, and it continues to haunt the way we talk about feminism today. It would
                also become foundational to the way the third wave would position itself as it emerged.

                It is almost impossible to talk with any clarity about the third wave because few people agree on
                exactly what the third wave is, when it started, or if it’s still going on. “The confusion surrounding
                what constitutes third wave feminism, is in some respects its defining feature.” (feminist scholar
                Elizabeth Evans.) But generally, the beginning of the third wave is pegged to two things: the Anita Hill
                case in 1991, and the emergence of the riot grrrl groups in the music scene of the early 1990s.
              </p>
              <p>
                Early third-wave activism tended to involve fighting against workplace sexual harassment and working to
                increase the number of women in positions of power. Intellectually, it was rooted in the work of
                theorists of the ’80s: Kimberlé Crenshaw, a scholar of gender and critical race theory who coined the
                term intersectionality to describe the ways in which different forms of oppression intersect; and Judith
                Butler, who argued that gender and sex are separate and that gender is performative. Crenshaw and
                Butler’s combined influence would become foundational to the third wave’s embrace of the fight for trans
                rights as a fundamental part of intersectional feminism.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aesthetically, the third wave is deeply influenced by the rise of the riot grrrls, the girl groups who
                stomped their Doc Martens onto the music scene in the 1990s.
              </p>
              <p>
                “BECAUSE doing/reading/seeing/hearing cool things that validate and challenge us can help us gain the
                strength and sense of community that we need in order to figure out how bullshit like racism,
                able-bodieism, ageism, speciesism, classism, thinism, sexism, anti-semitism and heterosexism figures in
                our own lives,” wrote Bikini Kill lead singer Kathleen Hanna in the Riot Grrrl Manifesto in 1991.
                “BECAUSE we are angry at a society that tells us Girl = Dumb, Girl = Bad, Girl = Weak.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The word girl here points to one of the major differences between second- and third-wave feminism.
                Second-wavers fought to be called women rather than girls: They weren’t children, they were fully grown
                adults, and they demanded to be treated with according dignity. There should be no more college girls or
                coeds: only college women, learning alongside college men.
              </p>
              <p>
                In part, the third-wave embrace of girliness was a response to the anti-feminist backlash of the 1980s,
                the one that said the second-wavers were shrill, hairy, and unfeminine and that no man would ever want
                them. And in part, it was born out of a belief that the rejection of girliness was in itself
                misogynistic: girliness, third-wavers argued, was not inherently less valuable than masculinity or
                androgyny.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third-wave feminism had an entirely different way of talking and thinking than the second wave did — but
                it also lacked the strong cultural momentum that was behind the grand achievements of the second wave.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third wave was a diffuse movement without a central goal, and as such, there’s no single piece of
                legislation or major social change that belongs to the third wave the way the 19th Amendment belongs to
                the first wave or Roe v. Wade belongs to the second.

                Feminists have been anticipating the arrival of a fourth wave. Internet trolls actually tried to launch
                their own fourth wave in 2014, planning to create a “pro-sexualization, pro-skinny, anti-fat” feminist
                movement that the third wave would revile, ultimately miring the entire feminist community in bloody
                civil war. (It didn’t work out.) But over the past few years, as #MeToo and Time’s Up pick up momentum,
                the Women’s March floods Washington with pussy hats every year, and a record number of women prepare to
                run for office, it’s beginning to seem that the long-heralded fourth wave might actually be here.
              </p>
              <p>
                While a lot of media coverage of #MeToo describes it as a movement dominated by third-wave feminism, it
                actually seems to be centered in a movement that lacks the characteristic diffusion of the third wave.
                It feels different.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Maybe the fourth wave is online,” said feminist Jessica Valenti in 2009, and that’s come to be one of
                the major ideas of fourth-wave feminism. Online is where activists meet and plan their activism, and
                it’s where feminist discourse and debate takes place. Sometimes fourth-wave activism can even take place
                on the internet (the “#MeToo” tweets), and sometimes it takes place on the streets (the Women’s March),
                but it’s conceived and propagated online.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like all of feminism, the fourth wave is not a monolith. It means different things to different people.
                The fourth-wave feminism is queer, sex-positive, trans-inclusive, body-positive, and digitally driven.
                And now the fourth wave has begun to hold our culture’s most powerful men accountable for their
                behavior. It has begun a radical critique of the systems of power that allow predators to target women
                with impunity.

                “By the late 20th century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated
                hybrids of machine and organism. In short, we are all cyborgs.” (post-humanist scholar and feminist
                theorist Donna Haraway in her iconic 1983 A Cyborg Manifesto.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Her essay addressed the artifice around gender norms, imagined the future of feminism, and proposed the
                cyborg as the leader of a new world order. Part human and part machine, the cyborg challenged racial and
                patriarchal biases. “This,” Haraway wrote, “is the self [that] feminists must code.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The field of cyberfeminism emerged in the early 1990s after the arrival of the world wide web, which
                went live in August 1991. Its roots, however, go back to the earlier practices of feminist artists like
                Lynn Hershman Leeson. Cyberfeminism came to describe an international, unofficial group of female
                thinkers, coders, and media artists who began linking up online. In the 1980s, computer technology was
                largely seen as the domain of men—a tool made by men, for men. Cyberfeminists asked: Could we use
                technology to hack the codes of patriarchy? Could we escape gender online?
              </p>
              <p>
                Haraway’s cyborg became the cyberfeminists’ ideal citizen for a post-patriarchal world, but there were
                other writers leaving an impression on the nascent movement, such as African-American sci-fi writer
                Octavia Butler. Her Xenogenesis trilogy (1987–89) is set in a post-apocalyptic future ruled by
                gene-trading aliens. Butler’s books broke with conservative conceptions of race and biology, describing
                aliens that were neither male nor female but a third sex, and who practiced interspecies breeding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cyberfeminism’s star rose throughout the 1990s, as a growing constellation of women began to practice
                under its umbrella in different corners of the world, including North America, Australia, Germany, and
                the U.K. The VNS Matrix, a four-woman collective of “power hackers and machine lovers” in South
                Australia, began to identify as cyberfeminists in 1992. In their own words, the collective “decided to
                have some fun with French feminist theory,” coding games and inventing avatars as a way to critique the
                macho landscape of the early web. As one of its members, Virginia Barratt, recalled in an interview with
                Vice’s Motherboard, “We emerged from the cyberswamp… on a mission to hijack the toys from techno-cowboys
                and remap cyberculture with a feminist bent.” They wrote their own Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st
                Century (1991) in homage to Haraway, presented as an 18-foot-long billboard, which was exhibited at
                various galleries across Australia. The text bulges from a 3D sphere, surrounded by images of DNA
                material and dancing, photomontaged women that have been transformed into scaled hybrids. “We make art
                with our cunts,” the manifesto reads. “We are the virus of the new world disorder.”
              </p>
              <p>
                As a comment on porn and the sexist elements of the gaming world, the group developed All New Gen, a
                now-legendary computer game charged with satire. Installed on an arcade machine at the Australian Centre
                for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, in 1995, the game follows a group of “cybersluts” as they enter the
                “Big Daddy Mainframe” and try and topple phallic power with G-slime—goo shot from weaponized clitorises.
                “We wanted something that was badass and complex, hot, wet, and mind-bending,” Barratt once said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Australian artist Linda Dement also used computer games to code alternative female identities. Her
                CD-ROM Cyberflesh Girlmonster (1995) takes the form of an adventure puzzle game, which Dement described
                as “a macabre comedy of monstrous femininity.” It’s a database of surreal monster-girls that Dement
                assembled from scans of female body parts. They are spliced, amphibious creatures that recall the
                grotesque photomontages of Dadaist Hannah Höch. An animated narrative in the game reveals that these
                cyborgs dream of revenge. “If only every woman could kill,” one text flashes on the screen. “The next
                man that touches me dies.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with artists and gamers, writers began to contribute to the emerging field. British theorist Sadie
                Plant launched a project to restore the legacy of women in technology, whose roles had been historically
                overlooked in preference for their male peers. Her book Zeros and Ones (1997), in particular, championed
                the figure of Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), a math genius and the disputed mother of computer programming,
                who created the first-ever algorithm in 1843.
              </p>
              <p>
                In North America, artists from the older feminist guard also took to the web. The new media pioneer Lynn
                Hershman Leeson had been developing an alter ego throughout the 1970s, named Roberta Breitmore, who she
                brought into existence with the help of hired actors and documentary evidence that she manufactured. In
                the ’90s, Leeson transplanted Roberta Breitmore into the internet, creating CybeRoberta, a doll whose
                camera eyes upload the real world online. She later directed a series of sci-fi feature films, like
                Conceiving Ada (1997), which was also based on the life of Ada Lovelace.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the West Coast, Faith Wilding, a groundbreaking feminist artist prominent in the 1970s for her
                participation in the seminal installation Womanhouse (1972), had begun to adopt the cyberfeminist
                moniker. Wilding began a collage series in the early 1990s called “Recombinants.” The works are composed
                of images of machines, plants, humans, and animal bodies, creating a point of intersection between life
                forms and technology. She described the results as “an uneasy, monstrous depository of melancholic
                historical fragments” in an artist statement.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1997, there were enough people identifying as cyberfeminists to warrant a meet-up. The First
                Cyberfeminist International was organized by a Berlin collective, satirically named the Old Boys Network
                after the circles of male privilege on which patriarchy feeds. The collective’s five women framed the
                event, which brought together 38 women from 12 countries at Documenta X in Kassel, Germany, as an
                opportunity “to get [your] hands dirty in the codes and hardware of information technology.” During the
                event, the programmers and artists produced a provocative anti-manifesto called 100 Anti-Theses of
                Cyberfeminism. “Cyberfeminism is not a fragrance,” it reads, “not boring... not a single woman... not a
                picnic… not an artificial intelligence... not lady-like... not mythical.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Cyberfeminism resisted easy definition and, as the manifesto showed, there were multiple iterations and
                conflicting notions of what it was—and was not. By 1997, the movement was running into trouble. Haraway
                and Butler’s texts had called for the dissolution of gender and racial hierarchies, but it was
                increasingly clear that cyberfeminism had failed to address race at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s more, the notion that the internet could be employed as a categorically liberated space proved to
                be too optimistic. It was following the Cyberfeminist International in Kassel that Wilding mounted an
                important critique of the movement. “The Net is not a utopia of nongender,” she wrote in Where is the
                Feminism in Cyberfeminism. “It is already socially inscribed with regard to bodies, sex, age, economics,
                social class, and race.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The cyberfeminists, Wilding claimed, had failed to actively interrogate the biases entrenched in
                cyberspace. “Being bad grrls on the internet is not by itself going to challenge the status quo,” she
                went on. “Cyberfeminism presents itself as inclusive, but the cyberfeminist writings assume an educated,
                white, upper-middle-class, English speaking, culturally sophisticated readership,” Wilding and Maria
                Fernandez wrote in the book Domain Errors: Cyberfeminist Practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                The movement’s advocates may have been bold and brazen, but while purporting to move beyond hierarchical
                divisions, Wilding felt that they had, unwittingly, reinstated them. She extended her practice to
                explore the intersection of feminism with other technologies beyond the internet, such as
                biotechnology—the next frontier for gender discrimination. She founded subRosa, an art collective that
                critiqued the racial and gender biases in assisted fertility and genetic engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the 2000s, cyberfeminists had morphed into new forms of feminism. “The narratives around liberation
                from racism, sexism, and so on in the brave new virtual world were promises that were empty,” Barratt of
                VNS Matrix reflected. “New strategies needed to be developed.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Feminists continue to utilize the web as a crucial tool for connecting women all over the world in order
                to overcome racial and gender privilege. The Global Feminism movement, for instance, aligns closely with
                advocates for racial justice in its campaigns for women’s rights, while post-colonial feminists like
                Chela Sandoval have talked of “an internetworked global feminism…for women of color who want to connect
                globally across diasporas.” As Wilding conjectured in Where is the Feminism in Cyberfeminism, “But if
                grrrl energy and invention were to be coupled with engaged political theory and practice... Imagine!”
              </p>
              <p>
                In the later 2000s, as developments in biotechnology continued to advance, techno-feminists like the
                trans-feminist philosopher Paul B. Preciado further deconstructed gender through methods such as hormone
                use. In his text Testo Junkie (2008), Preciado records his unsanctioned use of testosterone as both
                performance and political activism. Gender, Preciado demonstrates, is not a natural order, but something
                we can hack, and eventually code. He frames his hormone experiments in relation to radical amateurs of
                the past—women as healers, midwives, and herbalists, who were often labeled as witches for their
                unauthorized acts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, the Xenofeminists, a collective founded in 2014, are members of a “gender-abolitionist” movement
                that advocates for “gender-hacking” across the web. They believe the only way to ensure gender
                self-identification and self-expression is to make sex hormones available to all. This means challenging
                the current systems of pharmaceutical production—which protect and regulate hormone access—and building
                open-source gender-code platforms for hormone production to allow “laypeople” to grow them at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as Haraway and Butler envisioned building and destroying machines, identities, and categories, the
                Xenofeminists aim to incite an accelerated explosion of gender, “to enlarge our existing repertoire to
                one hundred blooming sexes.” Viva Cyberfeminism 2.0.

                daily lives with abstraction, virtuality, and complexity. XF constructs a feminism adapted to these
                realities: a feminism of unprecedented cunning, scale, and vision; a future in which the realization of
                gender justice and feminist emancipation contribute to a universalist politics assembled from the needs

                (Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation, 2015)
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2015, a website claiming the name laboriacuboniks.net published a manifesto, Xenofeminism: A Politics
                for Alienation. On the front page, there is a playfully creepy gif of the reanimation of a mummified
                figure coded as female and washed in magenta. This combined with the asynchronous neon flashing of the
                title and the byline, was not only intriguing but also suggestive of kind of joyful, constructively
                ironic self-reflection that is so often lacking in the piety of the manifesto form. Moreover, the
                attentively produced oddness of this format serves to clearly underline the “xeno” or alien element, as
                it made clear that this part of online space is very alien in comparison to the infinite scrolling
                pastel hellscapes of Zuckerberg and company. Once we get to the text, these expectations are confirmed.
                XF, as it came to be known, appeared to many within the overlapping niches that comprised its readership
                as a “shock to thought”, articulating new political trajectories stemming from some of the seemingly
                most abstract tendencies within contemporary philosophy. It seemed and still seems to many that the
                ideas in here could make things happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Xenofeminism is a “feminism frustrated with the need for its existence.” With regards to other
                feminisms, it is a scavenger. It strips for parts, reassembles, takes what it wants, hacks and
                reorients. It wants to develop a symbiotic or parasitic relation to already existing technologies
                (including those of thought). One of the timely passages from the manifesto alludes to xenofeminism’s
                willingness to deal with problems inherent to digital culture or global complexity and trespass where,
                it claims, feminist theory might not dare. Xenofeminism sees the rising wave of technocracy but instead
                of searching for a buoy, it wants to catch the surf. It wants “superior forms of corruption.” Its hands
                and souls are not pure but synthetic. Its body is not made in the Garden of Eden but continually
                engineered in accordance with available tools. There is nothing, it claims, “that cannot be studied
                scientifically and manipulated technologically.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “The Xenofeminist Manifesto,” first released online by Laboria Cuboniks in 2015 and later printed by
                Verso was a polemic and a provocation, borne out of furious paragraph assembling in a
                collectively-edited Google doc. If some hands were more crafty than others in this labor, we can only
                tell it by studying the solo work of its authors, picking and guessing, recognizing overlapping thematic
                or stylistic concerns across publications. This, however, would be to the displeasure of the collective,
                which asserted in the manifesto that Laboria Cuboniks is a blueprint for an open source software, “a
                mutable architecture,” a platform. For those who wanted to engage in an annotated polemic, this
                presented a dilemma: how can we debate with a faceless manifesto that changes its directions with ease,
                like colored blocks on a Rubik’s cube? Manifestos are slippery, incoherent. As Lucca Fraser of Laboria
                Cuboniks said, manifestos are like “stand up comedy...their job is to point things out… [t]o nudge you
                into adopting a point of view that might not have seemed available beforehand.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The initial commitment to anonymity was a tip of the hat to cyberfeminism. In the early days of our
                omnivorous cyberswamp the possibility of erasing and collectivising ourselves on anonymous networks was
                quite the narrative. The manifesto’s cyberpunky 90s online aesthetics allude in particular to VNS
                Matrix, the legendary “terminators of the moral code, mercenaries of slime...saboteurs of big daddy
                mainframe.” But anonymity is hard to preserve these days. Soon enough, faces were put to sentences and
                it became more difficult to not see the manifesto as an intersection of its makers’ specific interests
                rather than a generic layout.

                “In the name of feminism, ‘Nature’ shall no longer be a refuge of injustice, or a basis for any
                political justification whatsoever! If nature is unjust, change nature!” These lines spell the closing
                sentences of the manifesto. But what does nature mean here? Is changing nature about free access to
                hormones or geoengineering? Is it about breeding animals for human organ transplants? Is it about
                Monsanto crops, industrial farming and climate change? Is it about biology or health? Or maybe about
                developing ectogenesis chambers for all mammals? How can nature be just or unjust at all? Is that not a
                purely theological question?

              <p>
                There are two general ways to think about identity: destructive or restorative. The first is the idea
                that as subjects we should struggle against identities and recognize how they are constructed. While
                identity markers might serve us well in finding one another or even developing political projects, “[in
                the longer term] the full range of these traits should be stripped of their social significance, and
                therefore of their ability to act as vectors of discrimination”. This is a balancing act because
                patriarchy also calls for removing identity from consideration. The patriarchal project, however, is
                strongly irrational and subjective, for the only gendered characteristics it wants to abolish are those
                that it simultaneously constructs as ‘female.’ When patriarchy calls for the abolition of gender, what
                it means is the exclusion of those whom it perceives as women or ‘womanly.’ When the manifesto calls for
                the abolition of gender, it calls for a genuinely abolitionist project carried out through to the end,
                where gender becomes a meaningless designation and therefore identitarian “characteristics are no more a
                basis of discrimination than the color of one’s eyes,” as the manifesto puts it.
              </p>

                This is of no interest to xenofeminism, which, replicating Haraway’s cyborg, favors bio-synthetic,
                technologically-assembled bodies that escape ‘natural’ identities as smoothly as zombies crawl away from
                both death and life. For Haraway, whose influence on xenofeminism is clear, the ‘cyborg’ is “a world
                without gender, which is perhaps a world with no genesis,” without an origin to be recovered. In
                agreement with Judith Butler, the manifesto is not only opposed to gender binaries but to all possible
                gender formations that stake their claim in the belief that the gender ‘we were born with,’ whatever
                that may be, is natural and that all we need to do is to reclaim it.

                The idea of seizing technological progress to re-engineer reproduction has been enjoying popularity in
                recent conceptual fiction. In Louis Erdrich’s Future Home of the Living God, evolution runs backwards
                and women birth primordial species. In XX, a lesbian couple uses an ovum-to-ovum technology, which lets
                them conceive offspring without sperm. The Handmaid’s Tale, now adapted as a series, seduces with its
                reproductive dystopia. Reproductive labor is also at the heart of Hester’s book. This concerns both
                social reproduction and sexual reproduction.
              </p>
              <p>
                As described by Silvia Federici, with the rise of capitalism, most reproductive work was confined to the
                realm of the domestic, where women reproduce the fabric of society by giving birth to the workforce,
                managing the household and maintaining familial bonds. By naturalising and exploiting this unwaged
                labor, capitalism deferred the lion’s share of its own reproduction to women, who were perceived as
                ‘naturally’ predisposed to it. As dismissive as society is towards these jobs, they are the necessary
                social glue that assures the smooth reproduction of both the workplace and the family, with women’s
                secretarial, administrative, emotional, and sexual work as the invisible foundation.

                Gender refers to your innate sense of being — whether that matches what you were assigned at birth or
                not. It refers to any combination of how you express yourself, the roles you take on in society, and
                most importantly how you identify yourself. A social construct is something that was shaped by society,
                by cultural norms — as opposed to having been shaped by biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                So what “gender is a social construct” truly means is that the idea of being a man, woman or another
                gender is not innately biological. Rather, the idea of gender was created by society. I don’t think
                anyone can deny that parts of gender are socially constructed. It’s society that prevents women from
                having equal rights in many respects. It’s society that lets women wear pants, but not men wear dresses.
                And it’s society that largely ignores nonbinary genders and intersex conditions that challenge our
                simple two box categorizing system. But some people would argue: is it really society that has made men
                feel less free to express their emotions or are men biologically less emotional?
              </p>
              <p>
                Did society create the idea that women are less sexual beings or do they really en masse have less of a
                biological sex drive than men? And where do trans people fit into all of this? In those ways gender is a
                social construct, but being a social construct doesn’t preclude it from having very real impacts on our
                lives — like impacting what people call you, how you’re treated, what you’re supposed to wear, what kind
                of future you’re expected to have, and more. Those are societally-created elements of gender.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s imagine some utopian alternate universe where gender distinctions never became a thing. No one is
                assigned anything based on their external genitalia when they’re born. There are no girl names or boy
                names. There are no gendered pronouns. We don’t distinguish people in those ways. Everyone just is. The
                problem is that it’s never going to happen in our lifetimes or maybe ever on planet Earth. We have spent
                far too much time as humans categorizing ourselves based on gender. That’s not the world we live in or
                probably ever will, no matter how gender-defiant and fluid post-millennials are.
              </p>
              <p>
                So in the world we do live in now, these distinctions are real. As socially-constructed as they are,
                they are real experiences and pressures that we all face. Trans people face these pressures to an
                extreme degree. The gender dysphoria they experience is often tied to the social constructs of gender.
                It’s tied to the ways that different genders get treated in society, the ways that different genders are
                typically expected to look and behave — and even for people who philosophically believe in completely
                smashing the gender binary, parts of their dysphoria are probably going to manifest in ways that conform
                to that binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s something else beyond all the constructs of gender, something that we don’t quite understand
                from science yet, which determines that innate sense of gender. It’s gotta be something biological that
                makes us trans to begin with, but many of the feelings we experience in the day-to-day, especially with
                regard to gender attribution — or, how people perceive our gender — does have to do with social
                constructs.

                No good evidence exists to support the proposition that a sense of gender identity is innate (although
                it would be hard to prove either way). While the experience of those who say they were born with a
                gender identity is deeply-felt (thus real to those individuals) and aligns with current messages on this
                topic in wider society, the concept of gender identity has far more in common with socio-cultural
                constructs, rather than biological characteristics. If that is the case it cannot, by definition, be
                innate. However, there are also suggestions that there may exist some innate biological marker of gender
                (the hypothesis is that there may be a kind of ‘brain sex’, which can differ from the rest of the body’s
                ‘somatic sex’) and yet on the other hand that gender identity is fluid, self-identified and purely
                subjective.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until recently, the standard consensus has been that we gain self-awareness as children and young people
                of our sex and other bodily characteristics, as well as our abilities, attributes and character, as part
                of natural development that unfolds inexorably with time and interacts with family, school and
                community. An emerging, contrasting, view is that people are born with an innate sense of ‘gender
                identity’. For example, the website for GIRES, a well-known lobby group which has advised UK Government
                agencies such as the Office for National Statistics on how to define ‘gender’, contains a pdf
                information sheet depicting non-identical, dizygotic twins in utero, with a legend explaining that each
                fetus “identifies” either as a boy and a girl (GIRES, 2016).
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea that gender identity is fluid has its roots in post-modern philosophy, as exemplified in the
                writings of French philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, and later interpretations of these
                works by the American philosopher and feminist Judith Butler. Put simply, post-modernism proposes that
                our ways of understanding the world need to be ‘deconstructed’, and conventional boundaries need to be
                broken, in order to expose the multiple oppressions inherent in traditionally accepted knowledge
                structures, including science and medical science. Post-modernism privileges the subjective over the
                objective, the emotional over the rational. It holds that language shapes our understanding of what we
                experience as being reality to an extreme degree, with words having extraordinary power. According to
                Butler, gender is ‘performative’, by which she means that it comes about as a result of acts rather than
                representing who someone is (Butler, 2006). In this sense, her definition corresponds to the notion of
                gender as socially constructed, rather than innate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The proposition that a sense of ‘gender identity’ is inborn rather than socially constructed is held by
                some. Various studies have attempted to show how the brains of those identifying as transgender are
                different. Such studies are often confounded and inconsistent, or show small differences that are in the
                form of associations. They do not prove that a pre-existing innate gender leads to an individual
                identifying as transgender. The conclusions of those papers and their methodology have been criticised
                elsewhere in the scientific literature.
              </p>
              <p>
                If nothing about a person’s body is fixed or immutable, if all boundaries are there to be taken down,
                and if subjective experience is paramount, then anyone, regardless of their physical body, can
                confidently state “I feel like a woman (or man)” or indeed “I am a woman (or man)”. Or “I am agender”
                (or one or more of many varieties of nonbinary gender identities, where a person identifies as neither
                woman nor man, or both at the same time, or switches between identities). Where such feelings are
                strongly present, and where the inner sense of gender identity conflicts with biological sex, then the
                subjective sense of gender identity (a feeling) is taken to represent the person’s ‘true self’, rather
                than their objective sex (a bodily attribute). This self-identified ‘true self’ then takes precedence
                over bodily form; ‘sex’ is described as being ‘assigned’, thus gender identity supplants (as opposed to
                supplements) empirically observed reality. The name for the physical body is thereby downgraded to
                something that can be dismissed as ‘reductionist,’ acting to “privilege biology” over a person’s “lived
                and felt identity.” (GIDS, no date) Naming biological sex becomes reconceived as a purely arbitrary act
                performed by bureaucratic doctors and midwives that takes no note of the individual’s invisible,
                immeasurable, unquantifiable essence of femininity or masculinity, which, it is concluded, although
                indefinable, is internal and innate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Important consequences follow from this reasoning, some political and legal, others clinical. They will
                be relevant to health professionals, who are increasingly expected to offer invasive and life-changing
                medical and surgical interventions on the physical bodies of patients coming to clinic with the
                assertion that their body does not represent who they feel themselves to really be. Such clinical
                situations are not based on usual medical evidence applied to well-understood and researched phenomena
                of diseases or disorders.

                The label ‘gender non-binary’ operates as an umbrella term that falls within the broad spectrum of
                gender diversity and covers many identities such as a-gender, bi-gender, post-gen- der, gender-queer and
                gender fluid, all of which indicate nonconformity to gender stereotypes. Gender non-binary trans people
                differ from binary trans people mainly in that the latter accept the gender binary and aim to ‘cross’ it
                (FTM 1⁄4 female to male, MTF 1⁄4 male to female). Gender non-binary people are gaining more social
                visibility and some medical recognition. Different find- ings suggest that there is an increase in
                people identifying outside of the gender binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although, non-binary gender identities are not in fact new, both the actual terminology as well as
                ‘coming out’ as a non-binary trans person are relatively new. Representations of gender diversity in
                Western popular culture have probably helped in presenting gender diversity to the mainstream realm. In
                particular, the internet as a safe space for trans individuals has become significantly important for
                expanding their networks and educating themselves (and others). It has also served as a means of
                negotiating identities and as a place to “try out or test different identities”. Furthermore, the online
                realm is increasingly used for stimulating collective identity and is therefore important in developing
                a sense of belonging and engaging in activism. In all, it has greatly contributed to the visibility of
                the trans community. This is also the case for non-binary identities and their narratives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gender non-binary individuals disrupt and challenge the gender dichotomy. They therefore meet with
                problems like discrimination and transphobia. Despite a growing space for gender minorities, queer
                people in general have to deal with problems like harassment, violence, discrimination and other forms
                of inequality. Additionally, and in comparison to same-sex attracted people and binary-identified
                transgender people (that is, trans men and trans women), those who identify with a non-binary gender
                identity face extra difficulty, as they fit even less into the conventional fixed-gender matrix of the
                heterosexual female (femininity) or male (masculinity).

                It’s ironic that it was Alan Turing, a man whose very existence broke so many binaries from his
                sexuality to his neurodiversity, who birthed our binary world. Since then we have built our technology,
                economy, and society on digital binaries. If a computer cannot understand a problem, then the problem is
                forcibly simplified until the inputs and outputs are 1s and 0s. Black and white. Right and wrong.
                Complex concepts are lost and shades of grey are ignored.

                The UK was recently called out with Poland and Russia as a source of “extensive and often virulent
                attacks on the rights of LGBT+ people” by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The
                report went on to say that the UK was seeing a significant increase in anti-trans rhetoric from both
                politicians and the media and that the "baseless and concerning credibility" given to these views was
                “at the expense of both trans people’s civil liberties and women’s and children’s rights”.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the latest YouGov polling, 39% of people think giving increased recognition and rights to
                transgender people poses a genuine risk to some women's rights. That’s 4 in 10 people who cannot imagine
                anything but a zero-sum game. No matter how you cut the data, the UK is getting less progressive when it
                comes to trans rights.

                Uncomfortable boxes to try and squeeze into. We are those shades of blue that the English struggle to
                differentiate between. However it’s not about more boxes or more language - Facebook’s gender options
                provide me with 58 different boxes to be put in by a machine. I don’t want more boxes, I want box-less

                It “helps us feel a sense of certainty. In a complex world, binary thinking can feel comforting” (Drinko
                2021). It’s no wonder that with pandemics, wars, global recession, and climate change we’re looking for
                something comforting to hold onto! There are also evolutionary benefits - seeing the world as ‘things
                that are not sabretooth tigers’ and ‘things that are’ tends to be of benefit even if you lose a huge
                amount of nuance in your understanding of your surroundings. The Sabretooth tigers may have died out,
                but the binary fight-or-flight response is still with us.

                “This simple survival mechanic blinds us to the reality of the universe. While you may not agree that
                gender is on a spectrum, even the most hardened binarists of you would, I’m sure, agree that light and
                colour are. Yet even here binaries pervasively impact our thinking.”

                A 2007 study showed that when given a task to identify matching shades of blue, Russian speakers (a
                language that has colour terms for light blue and dark blue) were 10% faster than English speakers at
                identifying subtle differences (Winawar, J et al. 2007). This isn’t genetic - another study showed that
                Greek speakers (also two words: ghalazio and ble) who had lived in the UK for a long time began to lose
                their ability to tell the difference between shades as their English usage grew (Athanasopoulos 2010).
                English created a simplistic binary reality (blue/not blue) and took away their ability to see the
                spectrum.

                Certainty doesn’t need alternative viewpoints, it is right. Yet diversity of thought directly correlates
                to creative innovation and revenue. Companies with above-average diversity produced 19% more of their
                revenue through innovation and this directly translated into overall better ﬁnancial performance (Holger

                For your own mental health, for the financial future of our industry, for all of us - break away from
                blinding binaries. What will transitioning into a non-binary world feel like? It will be frightening,
                dangerous, and risky, but a wonderful freedom sits on the other side. Ask yourself - what type of human
                being are you? One wrought with cognitive dissonance? Someone considered a professional liar? Someone
                that passively supports the victimisation of 1% of the population? Or someone that embraces the freedom

                In our historical age, characterized by mutability, uncertainty and indeterminacy, the binary gender
                conception seems to be not suitable to describe individual gender identity experiences. Different people
                possess shifting amounts of “maleness” and “femaleness” and their innate perception of themselves does
                not fit with the sex assigned at birth (Garfinkel 1967; Bullough and Bullough 1993; McKenna and Kessler
                2006; Stryker and Whittle 2006). In this perspective not only is gender to be a social construct but so
                are sex and sexuality. People who do not fit with the sex assigned at birth are referred to as
                “transgender” persons. Transgender is an umbrella term concerning a wide range of gender identities.
                Ekins and King (2006) use the gerund “transgendering” to refer to the idea of moving from a pre-
                existing gender category to another, or living “between gender” or “beyond gender”.

                Lately, there have been many empirical efforts to broaden the dichotomous understanding of gender.
                Unlike seeing masculinity and femininity as opposite ends of a one dimensional gender scale, the current
                literature adopts a multidimensional approach in order to explore gender identity in a wider and more
                comprehensive sense. Gender identities are now conceived as plural, multidimensional, difficult to
                demarcate or classify. For example, the transformation of bodies, the changing rules of intimacy
                (Giddens 1991, 1992) and the birth of new family typologies are the reflection of the growing diversity
                and richness of gender identities. Gender can be deemed fluid (Bauman 2000, 2003) and unstable as it
                gives rise to a multiplicity of identities.

                Late modernity has undoubtedly influenced the perception of gender identity and the mass media has
                played an undeniable role in forming both traditional and niche identities (Giddens, 1991). The
                technological advancements of modernity have alternatively both empowered and disempowered the gender
                fluid individual. The advent of gender reassignment surgery, hormone replacement therapy and the global
                identity conditioning of the mass media have played monumental roles in the formation of contemporary
                gender identity, both in Western cultures and, as importantly, on a global scale (Feinberg, 1996). The
                advancement of the communications industry, significantly the Internet, has opened arenas of discussion
                never before encountered (Pullen, 2010). The ability for Western gender fluid communities to communicate
                in a relatively safe and anonymous virtual environment has played a key role in creating vocabulary and
                political standards specific to the gender fluid community. One example is the discussion of
                gender-neutral pronouns and concepts such as ‘gender queer’; advocating the deconstruction of
                gender/sexual specific signifiers (Danet, 1998). There is a definite need to encourage a congregational
                point for gender fluid community, either virtual or in actuality, even if only with an anthropological
                agenda in mind.

                Gender-queer, sex-queer, sexuality-queer, and ontologically queer characters appear in manga of all
                genres, marketed toward a variety of audiences. But what does “queer” mean? In this context it refers to
                situations, relationships, combinations, or images that challenge the binary structures that are
                normatively assumed to configure sex, gender, and sexuality. Binary structures are either/or — either
                gay or straight, either male or female, either feminine or masculine — but queer structures are
                both/neither: neither gay nor straight, neither male nor female, neither feminine or masculine. Or, to
                use anthropologist Patrick Galbraith’s wonderful phrasing, queer is a way of “encompass[ing] the
                unencompassable fluidity that exists outside normative paradigms.” (2011, 216).
              </p>
              <p>
                How does this all work in relation to manga? In the first place, manga is an interesting narrative
                medium because, unless our favorite manga characters are obliging enough to show them to us, we really
                have no idea what sort of genitalia they have, so we cannot come to any conclusions about their sex
                based on that sort of visual clue. And given the ambiguous iconography in some genres of manga, notably
                shōjo, in which characters intended to be male and characters intended to be female are drawn almost
                identically, we often cannot tell for sure what a character’s sex is unless they do take their clothes
                off so we can see their naked body.
              </p>
              <p>
                The well-known queer theorist Judith Butler has argued that “Sex is a forcible materialization of a
                ‘regulatory ideal’ [heterosexuality]: to materialize the body’s sex is ‘to materialize sexual difference
                in the service of the consolidation of the heterosexual imperative.’” (1993, 2). To put this simply, in
                the context of manga the reason readers are so anxious to know a character’s sex is because we want to
                know who they can “legitimately” have sex with. The heteronormativity of our world makes it imperative
                to know whether the couplings we see are hetero- or homo- sexual. But, as we have seen, many manga do
                not materialize sex differences, they constantly obscure it. What then becomes of the heterosexual
                imperative?
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, unless they are obliging enough to tell us explicitly, we have no idea what our characters’
                gender identity is. When theater studies scholar Natsu Onoda Power tells us that manga characters have
                no sex, but have gender in abundance, she is right, but only in the sense that they have gender
                performance in abundance, from which readers infer a cha- racter’s deep-seated gender identity (Onoda
                [Power] 2002, 132). We see a manga character who dresses in a feminine way and has a feminine hair-
                style, so we tend to assume that the character has a feminine gender identity. Sometimes we are right,
                and sometimes the story shows us later that our assumption was wrong.

                In the third major story arc of Naoko Takeuchi’s groundbreaking graphic narrative series, Bishōjo Senshi
                Sērā Mūn (or Sailor Moon, to English- speaking audiences), the protagonist finds herself questioning the
                sex of the person she has recently kissed. Judging from the cropped hair, male school uniform, and other
                characters’ repeated use of the masculine pronoun in reference to this individual, Usagi might safely
                assume it is a man. However, she has also seen Haruka on the battlefield—in a costume clearly revealing
                a female body. As her alluring acquaintance leans in for a second kiss, Usagi hesitantly asks, “Are you
                a guy… or a girl?” Haruka simply responds, “Guy or girl… is that so important?”
              </p>
              <p>
                The question echoes thematically throughout the rest of the series, prompting readers to examine their
                own preconceptions. As it turns out, Haruka is biologically female, but her gender identity is less
                clear. She wears both traditionally male and female clothes in her civilian life, and does not “correct”
                people when they assume she is a man. Though Takeuchi insists that Haruka was always intended to be a
                woman, dismissing fan theories that she had been a man in a past life (reincarnation is part of the
                series’ mythos), part of what makes Haruka so compelling to audiences is her defiance of the reductive
                male/female binary.

                Despite its technological advancement, Japan somehow manages to retain much of its historical character,
                in addition to blending in the overwhelming influences of the West. The Japanese treatment of gender and
                gender relations has taken many turns over the last millennium, and manga and anime reflect those
                changes. Still, at the core of the culture lies certain fundamental beliefs that are proving difficult
                to change.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a growing controversy over gender roles in Japan. The pervasiveness of sadistic, (heterosexual)
                male-oriented Japanese pornography in Japan which shows a message that women are sexual objects has
                become almost epidemic in Japanese culture. Many career women in Japan seem to be so disgusted with
                things that they refuse to marry. And too many men are expected to sacrifice themselves to their jobs,
                to the point of having no family involvement. When a man retires, he sometimes becomes trapped in a
                family he doesn't know, with nothing to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Individuality is more important than one's gender and hence to stereotype genders and to force people to
                conform to those stereotypes is not a good thing. we'd all be better off if each of us picked up the
                stereotypical strengths of both genders, if, say, men were more nurturing and women were more likely to
                speak and be heard.
              </p>

                One should of course realize that there are exceptions to every rule, and that Japanese manga, like
                English literature, runs the gamut from one end to the other. The theme of "men ought to be stronger
                than women" is a pervading theme that can sum up a lot of gender relations in manga and anime. The idea
                is that women, no matter how strong or independent they are, are actually looking for someone who they
                can depend on and who will protect them.
